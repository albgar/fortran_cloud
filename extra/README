The Makefile in this directory shows the incantations needed to build
on MacOS following the lines of the original recipe by Riccardo Bertossa
(sh bootstrap.sh, etc).

On the Mac the direct compilation of libzmq did not work out of the box due
to a problem locating or using gnutls, but libzmq itself can be installed
with Homebrew.
